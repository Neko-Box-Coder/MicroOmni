## üîçÔ∏è Fuzzy Search For Files Content Recursively

![Search Gif](./Resources/GlobalSearch.gif)

Recommended binding:
```json
{
    "Alt-F": "command:OmniGlobalSearch",
    //Windows
    "Alt-Shift-F": "command:OmniGlobalSearch"
}
```

To find a with keyword(s), launch command `OmniGlobalSearch` which is bindable to a key.
1. First it will ask you which directory to search from, if a relative path is give, 
this will be relative to current working directory (not to be confused with current file directory).
Leaving empty will default to current working directory.
    - `{fileDir}` can be used to substitute the directory path of the current file. 
2. If any text was selected prior to launching the `OmniGlobalSearch` command, that text will be used
for **fuzzy** searching. If not, a prompt will ask you what to **fuzzy** search.
3. If successful, a fzf window will be launched. Here are the keybindings by default:
    - up/down: Navigate results
    - alt-up / alt-down: Navigate half page of results
    - page-up / page-down: Scroll up and down for the preview window
    - alt-f: Search again with text in the input field (**Non fuzzy** but case insensitive)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fuzzy Search Settings
- `fzfCmd`: (Extending from fzfinder) The `fzf` location.
    - Defaults to `"fzf"`
- `fzfOpen`: (Extending from fzfinder) How to open the new file. Available options are:
    - `thispane`: (Default) Opens in current pane
    - `newtab`: Opens in new tab
    - `vsplit`: Opens in new pane as vertical split
    - `hsplit`: Opens in new pane as horizontal split
- `OmniGlobalSearchArgs`: Argument to be passed to fzf. It defaults to the following:
```lua
OmniGlobalSearchArgs =  "--bind 'alt-f:reload:rg -i -uu -n {q}' "..
                        "--delimiter : -i "..
                        "--bind page-up:preview-half-page-up,page-down:preview-half-page-down,"..
                        "alt-up:half-page-up,alt-down:half-page-down "..
                        "--preview-window '+{2}-/2' "..
                        "--preview 'bat -f -n --highlight-line {2} {1}'"
```

## üß≠ Fuzzy Search For Current File
![Local Gif](./Resources/LocalSearch.gif)

```json
{
    "Alt-f": "command:OmniLocalSearch"
}
```

Similar to "Fuzzy Search For Files Recursively", this do a fuzzy search for the current file.
This is achieved by `bat` the file on disk to `fzf`, therefore you should save before searching.

The default control is the same as "Fuzzy Search For Files Recursively".

To search, simply launch the `OmniLocalSearch` command.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fuzzy Search Settings
- `OmniLocalSearchArgs`: Argument to be passed to fzf with `{filePath}` substitute with 
the current file path. It defaults to the following:
```lua
OmniLocalSearchArgs =   "--bind 'start:reload:bat -n --decorations always {filePath}' "..
                        "-i "..
                        "--bind page-up:preview-half-page-up,page-down:preview-half-page-down,"..
                        "alt-up:half-page-up,alt-down:half-page-down "..
                        "--preview-window '+{1}-/2' "..
                        "--preview 'bat -f -n --highlight-line {1} {filePath}'"
```


## üî≤ Centering Cursor To Viewport
![Center Gif](./Resources/Center.gif)
Recommended binding:
```json
{
    "Alt-m": "command:OmniCenter"
}
```

It centers your cursor to the middle of your viewport.

## ü¶ò Jump Selection
![Jump Select Gif](./Resources/JumpSelect.gif)

Recommended binding:
```json
{
    "Alt-J": "command-edit:OmniJumpSelect ",
    //Windows
    "Alt-Shift-J": "command-edit:OmniJumpSelect "
}
```

To select a section based on line number, launch the `OmniJumpSelect` command with 
the line number specified. 

By default it uses relative line numbers, so 5 is 5 lines down and -5 is 5 lines up.
This can be configured to use absolute line number. See settings.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Jump Selection Type Settings
- `OmniSelectType`: Sets the jump selection type. Can either be `relative` (default) or `absolute`


## üìî Global Cursor History
![Global Cursor History Gif](./Resources/GlobalHistory.gif)

Recommended binding:
```json
{
    "Alt-{": "command:OmniPreviousHistory",
    "Alt-}": "command:OmniNextHistory"
}
```

When you are editing multiple files or jumping between different functions, 
a history of the cursor location is stored. You can go to previous or next cursor position
by launching the `OmniPreviousHistory` and `OmniNextHistory` commands.

This is similar to the navigate back and forward commands in VSCode

### ‚öôÔ∏è Global Cursor History Settings
- `OmniHistoryLineDiff`: Sets how many line difference count as new cursor history. Defaults to 5

<!-- - `fzfpath`: The root path to search from, can be absolute path or relative to open file by setting to `relative`. -->
<!--     -If empty or not specified, defaults to directory where micro was launched -->

## üìÅ Copy Current File Path

Recommended binding:

None (Invoke it in command pane)

You can copy the current file absolute or relative path with `OmniCopyRelativePath` and 
`OmniCopyAbsolutePath` command.


## üî¶ Highlight Only (Before finding next)
Recommended binding:
```json
{
    "Alt-h": "command:OmniHighlightOnly"
}
```

- `OmniHighlightOnly`: TODO
