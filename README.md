## 🔍️ Fuzzy Search For Text Globally

![Search Gif](./Resources/GlobalSearch.gif)

> [!NOTE]
> The above gif is from older version.
> The latest version will show the default keybindings in fzf
> ![Search Header](./Resources/SearchHeader.png)

Recommended binding:
```json
    "Alt-F": "command:OmniGlobalSearch",
    //Windows
    "Alt-Shift-F": "command:OmniGlobalSearch"
```

To find a with keyword(s), launch command `OmniGlobalSearch` which is bindable to a key.
1. Enter the search directories
    - Empty for current root directory. 
    - `{fileDir}` can be used to substitute with current file directory
    - Use `,` to separate directories, for example `./MyDir,./MyDir2`
    - Prefix `!` to exclude a directory, for example `!./ExcludeThisDir`
2. Enter keywords (separated by spaces) to be searched (This is using ripgrep and not fuzzy search)
3. If successful, a fzf window will be launched. You can now filter with fzf fuzzy search. 
4. Here are the keybindings by default configured:
    - **enter**: Select
    - **alt-enter**: Output the current filtered results to a new buffer
    - **up/down**: Navigate results
    - **alt-up / alt-down**: Navigate half page of results
    - **page-up / page-down**: Scroll up and down for the preview window
    - **alt-f**: Search again with text in the input field (**Non fuzzy** but case insensitive)
    - **alt-q**: Abort

### ⚙️ Fuzzy Search Settings
- `MicroOmni.FzfCmd`: The `fzf` location.
    - Defaults to `"fzf"`
- `MicroOmni.NewFileMethod`: How to open the new file. Available options are:
    - `smart_newtab`: (Default) Opens the new file in newtab if not opened already
    - `thispane`: Opens in current pane
    - `newtab`: Opens in new tab
    - `vsplit`: Opens in new pane as vertical split
    - `hsplit`: Opens in new pane as horizontal split
- `MicroOmni.GlobalSearchArgs`: Argument to be passed to fzf. It defaults to the following:
```lua
    config.RegisterCommonOption('MicroOmni', 'GlobalSearchArgs', 
            "--header='enter: select | alt-enter: output filtered results | alt-q/esc: exit | "..
            "page-[up/down]: preview-[up/down] | alt-[up/down]: half-page-[up/down]' "..
            "--bind 'alt-f:reload:rg --glob=!.git/ -i -F -uu -n {q}' "..
            "--delimiter : -i --reverse "..
            "--bind page-up:preview-half-page-up,page-down:preview-half-page-down,"..
            "alt-up:half-page-up,alt-down:half-page-down,alt-q:abort "..
            "--bind 'alt-enter:change-multi+select-all+accept' "..
            "--preview-window 'down,+{2}-/2' "..
            "--preview 'bat -f -n --highlight-line {2} {1}'")
```

## 🧭 Fuzzy Search For Text Locally

![Local Gif](./Resources/LocalSearch.gif)

Recommended binding:
```json
    "Alt-f": "command:OmniLocalSearch"
```

Similar to "Fuzzy Search For Text Globally", this do a fuzzy search for the current file.
This is achieved by `bat` the file on disk to `fzf`, therefore you should save before searching.

The default control is the same as "Fuzzy Search For Text Globally".

To search, simply launch the `OmniLocalSearch` command.

### ⚙️ Fuzzy Search Settings
- `MicroOmni.LocalSearchArgs`: Argument to be passed to fzf with `{filePath}` substitute with 
the current file path. It defaults to the following:
```lua
    config.RegisterCommonOption('MicroOmni', 'LocalSearchArgs', 
            "--header='enter: select | alt-enter: output filtered results | alt-q/esc: exit | "..
            "page-[up/down]: preview-[up/down] | alt-[up/down]: half-page-[up/down]' "..
            "--bind 'start:reload:bat -n --decorations always {filePath}' "..
            "-i --reverse "..
            "--bind page-up:preview-half-page-up,page-down:preview-half-page-down,"..
            "alt-up:half-page-up,alt-down:half-page-down,alt-q:abort "..
            "--bind 'alt-enter:change-multi+select-all+accept' "..
            "--preview-window 'down,+{1}-/2' "..
            "--preview 'bat -f -n --highlight-line {1} {filePath}'")
```

## 📔 Global Cursor History
When you are editing multiple files or jumping between different functions, 
a history of the cursor location is stored. You can go to previous or next cursor position
by launching the `OmniPreviousHistory` and `OmniNextHistory` commands.

This is similar to the navigate back and forward commands in VSCode
![Global Cursor History Gif](./Resources/GlobalHistory.gif)

```json
    "Alt-m": "command:OmniCenter"
```

---

## 🚩 Selection Marker

A multi cursor selection marker which marks the beginning of a selection when called the first time.
And then perform the selection to the current cursors positions when called the second time.

![Selection Marker Gif](./Resources/SelectionMarker.gif)


Recommended binding:
```json
    "Alt-S": "command-edit:OmniSelectMark",
    //Windows
    "Alt-Shift-S": "command-edit:OmniSelectMark"
```

---

## 🦘 Jump Selection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is deprecated, and will be removed in a few feature releases. Use the more flexible
> [🚩 Selection Marker](#-selection-marker) instead

![Jump Select Gif](./Resources/JumpSelect.gif)

Recommended binding:
```json
    "Alt-J": "command-edit:OmniJumpSelect ",
    //Windows
    "Alt-Shift-J": "command-edit:OmniJumpSelect "
```

To select a section based on line number, launch the `OmniJumpSelect` command with 
the line number specified. 

By default it uses relative line numbers, so 5 is 5 lines down and -5 is 5 lines up.
This can be configured to use absolute line number. See settings.

### ⚙️ Jump Selection Type Settings
- `MicroOmni.SelectType`: Sets the jump selection type. Can either be `relative` (default) or `absolute`

---

## 🔀 Better Multi Cursor

It spawns/moves your cursor to the next [highlight](#-highlight-only-before-finding-next) match, 
or act the same as `SpawnMultiCursor` if there's no [highlight](#-highlight-only-before-finding-next)

Meaning you can use regex expression to spawn multi-cursors.

Recommended binding:
```json
    "Alt-d": "command:OmniSpawnCursorNextHighlight"
    //OmniMoveLastCursorNextHighlight
```

### ⚙️ Better Multi Cursor Settings
Due to how the lua interface works, `AddCursor()` (from micro) was not added until recently. 
Therefore, a workaround was created to add multi cursor but this doesn't behave exactly like 
`SpawnMultiCursor`.

The differences are that `AddCursor()` will **select** the highlight text but the workaround will 
simply just add the cursor to the end of the highlight.

This can be set with `OmniCanUseAddCursor`.

If you are on latest master or using [my fork](https://github.com/Neko-Box-Coder/micro-dev/actions)
you can safely turn `OmniCanUseAddCursor` on, otherwise just leave it because it can crash micro.

- `MicroOmni.CanUseAddCursor`: Sets if MicroOmni can use the `AddCursor()` interface or not.
    - Defaults to `false`

The default control is the same as "Fuzzy Search For Text Globally".

To search, simply launch the `OmniTabSearch` command.

### ⚙️ Fuzzy Search Settings
- `MicroOmni.NewFileMethod`: Same as previous

            "page-[up/down]: preview-[up/down] | alt-[up/down]: half-page-[up/down]' "..

## 🧦 Diff View
To compare the current buffer with another buffer of file, launch the `OmniDiff` command.
Buffers are not required to be saved in order to perform the diff.

![Diff View Gif](./Resources/FileDiff.gif)

When being asked on what to diff, you can either specify a **filename** or a **tab**
The syntax for diffing a tab is as follow
`tab:[+/-]<tab index>[:<split index>]`

With `+` or `-` means it will be relative tab index, or absolute otherwise, similar to `tabmove`.
The split index can be used to specify which split to be diff against

Recommended binding:

None (Invoke it in command pane)
